0,[Diabetes mellitus in children: a heterogeneous disease].,"Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. Type 1, or autoimmune diabetes accounts for more than 95% of cases. Nevertheless, over the past years it has become apparent that not all cases of diabetes presenting in children are autoimmune type 1. In these cases, the diagnosis is facilitated by the fact that many rare etiologies of diabetes are associated with specific clinical syndromes or a characteristic age of onset. In addition, molecular diagnosis is becoming increasingly available for several of these disorders. This review aims to provide the general physician with some important clues to make an accurate diagnosis in these patients and understand its implication in clinical management."
1,Primary prevention of diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the chronic noncommunicable diseases that have increased markedly in this century. The discovery of insulin and other drugs for lowering hyperglycemia have certainly reduced mortality from acute complications of diabetes and improved the quality of life of many diabetic patients. Recent advances in research into the etiology and natural history of diabetes have increased our knowledge about different types of diabetes to such an extent that primary prevention of diabetes mellitus is becoming a reality. Until now, few studies have attempted to test measures for primary prevention of diabetes. Therefore, the data supporting the possibility for primary prevention are largely indirect and need to be tested in preventive trials or in community-based prevention programs. We believe, however, that the time is right to start action in populations in which the prevalence of diabetes is known to have clearly increased recently. We summarize the evidence that can be used as the scientific basis of primary prevention of diabetes mellitus."
2,[Post-transplantational diabetes mellitus].,"Newly developed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are frequent post-transplantation metabolic complications. In most reports, the incidence of newly-diagnosed diabetes in such patients varies from 10 to 26%. They are at high risk of cardiovascular complications, infections, graft rejection, and impaired survival compared with recipients having normal blood glucose level. Some of the above risk factors are common for the general population (age, excess body weight, familial diabetes, afroamerican ethnicity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia). Specific risk factors characteristic of the post-transplantation period include the use of glucocorticoids and imunodepressants (especially tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors) as well as infections (HCV and possibly cytomegalovirus). Screening for diabetes and evaluation of risk factors are recommended to all patients before and after transplantation. Patients of high-risk groups should be treated using non-diabetogenic protocols of immunosuppression. Achievement of normoglycemia, control of lipid levels and arterial pressure, screening for diabetes complications are indispensable components of the treatment aimed at the improvement of clinical outcome in the patients developing diabetes after organ transplantation."
3,Complications of type 1 diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide and the concern regarding the number of new cases of diabetes relates to the development of chronic complications. It has been recognized for years that the complications are a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide and as such, negatively affect the quality of life in individuals with diabetes with an increase in disability and death. Specifically, the complications of diabetes have been classified as either microvascular (ie, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) or macrovascular (ie, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and peripheral vascular disease). For purposes of this article, the authors focus on a brief review of the major complications."

7,Twin studies in diabetes mellitus.,"Twin studies are a valuable way of determining the relative significance of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of disease. In diabetes mellitus, they are of importance, since the aetiologies of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus are probably different. However the results of twin studies have not always been reliable. Strict adherence to methodological guidelines is necessary to ensure the validity of the results that are obtained. These guidelines relate to ascertainment of a twin sample, confirmation of zygosity, and effects of sampling. Critical review of twin studies in diabetes performed to date imply provisionally a very strong genetic input to the aetiology of Type 1 diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes genetic and environmental factors are probably of equal importance."
