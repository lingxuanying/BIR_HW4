0,[Diabetes mellitus: impact of affects on self-management skills].,"Diabetes self-management (DSM) is a process based on a series of complex learnings. The conceptualization of the role of the emotional dimensions that underlie and structure this process is critical to better understand why living with diabetes can become a burden. A clinical case illustrates the intertwining of the affective and cognitive dimensions of diabetes burden and its influence on DSM skills. Emotional regulation is a recognized determinant to implement effective and long-term DSM skills as well as access to DSM interventions. In order to improve DSME/S interventions efficacy, the role of emotional dimensions, new technologies and therapeutic advances needs to be considered."
1,[Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus].,"Musculoskeletal abnormalities are common and multiple in diabetic patients. They often result from pathologic changes in the microvasculature (microangiopathy), connective tissue, and peripheral nerves related to chronic hyperglycaemia. Their prevalence in patients with diabetes vary depending upon the diagnostic criteria, the study population and is generally correlated with poor glycaemic control and the occurrence of other complications of diabetes. These entities are important to recognize because they often respond to treatment, preventing pain and disability and improving quality of life."

3,Chromogranin A and its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.,"Chromogranin A is a member of the granin glycoprotein family that is expressed by the endocrine and neuroendocrine cells of different organs. Intracellularly, chromogranin A contributes to the regulation of secretion and gives several cleavage products after secretion. Some of its cleavage products modify the hormone functions in autocrine and paracrine ways, while the functions of others have not been fully understood yet. Serum chromogranin A level is most prominently used in neuroendocrine tumour diagnostics. In addition, recent studies have suggested that chromogranin A and some of its cleavage products (pancreastatin and WE-14) also play important roles in the pathogenesis of the various forms of diabetes mellitus, but their exact mechanisms still need to be clarified. Higher chromogranin A, pancreastatin, and WE-14 levels have been reported in type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. A notable connection has been inferred through the observation that type 1 diabetes mellitus is not at all or rarely developed in chromogranin A gene-knockout, non-obese diabetic model mice compared to non-knockout, non-obese diabetic mice. Pancreastatin inhibits insulin release in various cell and animal models, and WE-14 serves as an autoantigen for both CD4+ and CD8+ beta cell-destructive diabetogenic T-cell clones in type 1 diabetes. Chromogranin A contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus according to the available literature. The current findings facilitate further investigation to unravel the deeper relationships between this glycoprotein and diabetes."

7,Treatment Goals in Diabetes.,"The quality of glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus relies on accurate individualization of available treatment options. Treatment targets depend on the type and duration of diabetes, the patients' abilities and characteristics and the individual risk for acute and/or late-stage complications. These complications include hypoglycaemia, which can be severe and life threatening, hyperglycaemia, which is a main factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, and macrovascular and microvascular disease, both of which are hallmark features of diabetes-associated constraints. Moreover, other treatment goals in diabetic patients influence both glycaemic control and quality of life. Lipoproteins, blood pressure, weight control, mental health and lifestyle are important factors that contribute to the frequency of diabetes-associated complications."
