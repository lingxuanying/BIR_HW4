0,Scleroderma heart disease.,"Heart disease is a frequent and often severe feature of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Cardiomyopathy, with ventricular diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias, is the most important form, since it is associated with a very poor prognosis. The current challenge is to define its pattern and identify individuals at risk, but evaluation in vivo may be hard to perform. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the clinical aspects of scleroderma heart disease and the early pivotal role that coronary microcirculation dysfunction plays in its development. A discussion of the diagnostic tools now available for this frequently asymptomatic condition will be provided. Treatment options will be reviewed, even though no cure for systemic sclerosis exists, and the current therapy of diastolic dysfunction remains unsatisfactory."
1,Regionalization of congenital heart disease care: A pending goal.,"Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are considered the most frequent malformations. In Mexico, every year between 12 and 16 thousand children are born with some type of CHD and it is the second cause of mortality in children under 1 year of age and in children aged between 1 and 4 years. The problem of the care of CHDs is analyzed from a perspective of health policies in the country with an emphasis on regionalizing their care to rationalize the use of available resources and with the aim of serving the largest number of patients and achieve the best clinical results. It emphasizes the need to promote cooperation among the different civil society organizations and institutions to exchange ideas to create consensus and joint projects for a better use of available resources to achieve universal and quality care of children with CHD in all the country."
2,Systemic sclerosis and the heart.,"Heart disease, either clinically apparent or silent, is a frequent complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc, scleroderma) and may affect both patients with diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous SSc. The availability of more sensitive modalities has led to an increased awareness of scleroderma heart disease, which often involves the pericardium, myocardium, and cardiac conduction system. This awareness of cardiac involvement requires attention and interventions led by internists, cardiologists, and rheumatologists. Although no specific therapy exists for scleroderma heart disease, early recognition of the presence and type of scleroderma heart disease may lead to more effective management of patients with scleroderma."
3,Liver disease related to the heart.,"In this article, we review both acute and chronic liver diseases that occur as a result of heart or circulatory system failure. Ischemic hepatitis, congestive hepatopathy, cardiac cirrhosis, and Fontan liver disease are reviewed. We review clinical presentation, diagnostic data, prognosis, and available therapeutic strategies for these entities. We aim to increase awareness about cardio-hepatic disease as the prevalence of this disorder in adults is increasing. Due to advances in medical and surgical care, patients with heart disease are living longer and thus exposing long-term effects on the liver that are clinically relevant. There may be a role for dual organ transplantation in some cases, but this is a very challenging endeavor, and newer ideas about treatment or prevention are needed."

6,Heart disease in children.,"Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical management of neonates with cardiovascular disease has led to their improved survival rates. These improvements have resulted in an increased number of pediatric patients presenting to the primary care physician's office with underlying heart disease. Understanding the genetic, congenital, or acquired etiologies to the various pediatric heart diseases is crucial to preventing these lesions and treating these patients."

8,"Heart disease in cattle: diagnosis, therapeutic approaches and prognosis.","Heart disease in cattle remains medically challenging both to diagnose and to treat. This is in part due to its low incidence in the bovine species but also because the prognosis is typically guarded to poor. The majority of published data concerning bovine heart disease are case studies and case reports. The aim of this article is to review the evidence-based medicine on the principal heart diseases of cattle (pericarditis, bacterial endocarditis, congenital heart defects, cor pulmonale, dilated cardiomyopathy and heart neoplasms), with emphasis on their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment."
9,A systematic review of yoga for heart disease.,"Background: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for yoga as an ancillary intervention for heart disease. Methods: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and IndMED were searched up to October 2013. Main outcome measures were mortality, nonfatal cardiac events, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors. Risk of bias, quality of evidence, and the strength of the recommendation for or against yoga were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and GRADE recommendations. Results: Seven RCTs with 624 patients comparing yoga to usual care were included. For coronary heart disease (four RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, for a reduced number of angina episodes, and for increased exercise capacity, and low evidence for reduced modifiable cardiac risk factors. For heart failure (two RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and low evidence for increased exercise capacity, and for no effect on health-related quality of life. For cardiac dysrhythmias treated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (one RCT), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and for improved quality, and low evidence for effects on nonfatal device-treated ventricular events. Three RCTs reported safety data and reported that no adverse events occurred. Conclusions: Based on the results of this review, weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of yoga for patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia at this point."
