0,[Pediatric cardiology and congenital heart disease: from fetus to adult].,"This article contains a review of some of the most important publications on congenital heart disease and pediatric cardiology that appeared in 2010 and up until September 2011. Of particular interest were studies on demographic changes reported in this patient population and on the need to manage the patients' transition from the pediatric to the adult cardiology department. This transition has given rise to the appearance of new areas of interest: for example, pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease, and the effect of genetic factors on the etiology and transmission of particular anomalies. In addition, this review considers some publications on fetal cardiology from the perspective of early diagnosis and, if possible, treatment. There follows a discussion on new contributions to Eisenmenger's syndrome and arrhythmias, as well as on imaging techniques, interventional catheterization and heart transplantation. Finally, there is an overview of the new version of clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with congenital heart disease and of recently published guidelines on pregnancy in women with heart disease, both produced by the European Society of Cardiology."
1,The natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for adults with congenital heart disease.,"Thanks to improved treatment of congenital heart disease early in life, many such patients reach adulthood. Adults with congenital heart disease are an increasing population, which will continue to grow in the future. The clinical state of these patients is affected by their complex heart diseases, as well as the consequence of past corrective or palliative interventions. The natriuretic peptides are important markers for the presence, severity and prognosis of heart disease. The majority of the current knowledge is on patients with acquired heart disease. This article reviews the present knowledge regarding the role of the natriuretic peptides in adults with various forms of congenital heart disease."
2,Long-term cardio-respiratory consequences of heart disease in childhood.,"The dynamic interaction between the heart and lungs leads to a degree of respiratory co-morbidity including both restrictive and obstructive airway abnormalities, which may be overlooked in children with congenital and acquired heart disease. The improving imaging techniques of the heart, both foetal and post-natal coupled with minimally invasive techniques for device implantation and better operative techniques for complex congenital heart disease have resulted in more children with longitudinally documented structural heart disease surviving into their adult years. Children presenting with cardiomyopathy or arrhythmias, as well as those with repaired cardiac disease, can be offered advice with regard to formal exercise testing and participation in sports, which may be particularly helpful in the adolescent years. Furthermore, through the interest of some adult cardiologists in paediatric heart disease over the past 20 years, facilities for the smooth transition of care to adult services are improving."
3,Alcoholic heart disease.,"Alcohol has been suspected for many years of being a cause of heart disease. For a while its role was obscured by its association with beriberi heart disease and, more recently, by the toxic effect of cobalt in beer. Experimental studies, however, have provided convincing evidence of the primary role of alcohol itself. The mode of action is still in dispute. In the absence of specific findings, the diagnosis is made chiefly by exclusion of other known causes of heart disease and by a history of excessive alcohol intake over a number of years. The usual methods of treatment for the manifestations of heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic phenomena are important, but total abstinence from alcohol is the single essential factor. The sooner this is instituted, the better is the chance of interrupting the otherwise inexorable course to death."
4,Pregnancy and heart disease: a review.,"About one per cent of all pregnancies are affected by maternal heart disease, which may have significant influence on the maternal and foetal outcome. In this context rheumatic heart disease is declining and congenital heart disease is becoming the dominant category. Our experience of pregnancy in the new groups of patients created by paediatric heart surgery is scant and a continuous update is required."
5,Prevention of heart disease.,
6,[Viruses and heart disease].,
7,"[Progress in pediatric cardiology, congenital heart disease in adults, and heart surgery for congenital heart disease].","The field of pediatric cardiology is continually developing and now covers not only congenital and acquired heart disease in children but also congenital heart disease in adults and the prenatal diagnosis and prevention of heart disease. This review highlights new findings in the field of genetics, selected articles on the use of magnetic resonance imaging and multislice CT in diagnosis, and recent publications on electrophysiology and the surgical treatment of children and adults with congenital heart disease. In addition, the increasingly advanced use of mechanical assist devices as a bridge to heart transplantation in children is also discussed."
8,Heart disease in patients with stroke. Part II: Impact and implications for rehabilitation.,"Cardiac disease reduces the long-term survival of stroke patients and increases the likelihood of intercurrent medical illness during the rehabilitation phase. It remains controversial whether heart disease negatively affects functional capabilities after stroke, but most studies agree that associated cardiac disease, especially congestive heart failure, adversely affects functional outcomes after stroke rehabilitation. Reliable clinical assessment of the presence and severity of heart disease in stroke patients may be hampered by mobility limitations, communication deficits, and other problems. Therefore, specialized diagnostic methods may be needed. The development and application of effective and consistent medical and rehabilitation guidelines for proper comprehensive care may enhance the likelihood of achieving favorable outcomes and of avoiding complications in patients with stroke."
9,Interventional treatment of structural heart disease.,"Transcatheter therapy of structural heart disease is advancing rapidly. Due to the less invasive approach, transcatheter techniques have replaced surgery as standard procedure for atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale closure. Evolving interventional techniques allow treatment of paravalvular leaks, ventricular septal defects and valve replacement. Until recently, therapy for these diseases was limited to patients in whom severe comorbidities lead to contraindications to surgery. Techniques to treat heart failure caused by left ventricular aneurysms or to prevent cardioembolic stroke by percutaneous occlusion of the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation are emerging. This article reviews current indications and recent developments in interventional treatment of structural heart disease."
