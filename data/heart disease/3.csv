0,Sustained ventricular tachycardia in structural heart disease.,"Ventricular arrhythmias are responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths (SCD), particularly in patients with structural heart disease. Coronary artery disease, essentially previous myocardial infarction, is the most common heart disease upon which sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs, being reentry the predominant mechanism. Other cardiac conditions, such as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Chagas disease, sarcoidosis, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies, and repaired congenital heart disease may also present with VT in follow-up. Analysis of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for diagnosis. There are numerous electrocardiographic criteria that suggest VT with good specificity. The ECG also guides us in locating the site of origin of the arrhythmia and the presence of underlying heart disease. The electrophysiological study provides valuable information to establish the mechanism of the arrhythmia and guide the ablation procedure, as well as to confirm the diagnosis when dubious ECG. Given the poor efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, adjunctive catheter ablation contributes to reduce the frequency of VT episodes and the number of shocks in patients implanted with a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). ICD therapy has proven to be effective in patients with aborted SCD or sustained VT in the presence of structural heart disease. It is the only therapy that improves survival in this patient population and its implantation is unquestioned nowadays."
1,Biomarkers in pediatric heart disease.,"A biomarker is a characteristic that can be used as an indicator of a biological state. A biomarker can be a clinical observation, laboratory test or an imaging parameter. In this review, we discuss the use of biomarkers in differentiating cardiac from noncardiac disease; predicting the prognosis of patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy; diagnosing subclinical cardiac involvement in muscular dystrophy and postchemotherapy cancer patients; detecting acute rejection following heart transplantation; diagnosing Kawasaki disease; aiding the management of postoperative cardiac patients; and managing both common (tetralogy of Fallot) and complex (single-ventricle physiology) congenital heart diseases."
2,"Heart transplantation in biventricular congenital heart disease: indications, techniques, and outcomes.","Heart transplantation is an accepted therapeutic modality for end-stage congenital heart disease for both biventricular and univentricular anomalies. Many transplant centers have pushed the limits of transplantation to include patients with high pulmonary vascular resistance, high panel reactive antibodies, positive cross-matches, and ABO-incompatibility. Excellent results have been possible, particularly with the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to prevent and treat rejection, infection, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Late graft failure and chronic rejection remain vexing problems. The vast majority of patients with biventricular congenital heart disease have undergone prior cardiac surgical procedures. Indications for transplantation in this subgroup are primarily progressive refractory heart failure following prior cardiac surgical reconstructive procedures. Contraindications to transplantation mimic those for other forms of end-stage heart disease. A determination of pulmonary vascular resistance is important in listing patients with biventricular congenital heart disease for heart transplantation. Modifications in the implant technique are necessary and vary depending on underlying recipient anatomy. Risk factors for perioperative outcomes in patients with biventricular congenital heart disease include the need for reoperation, the degree of anatomic reconstruction necessary during the implant procedure, and the degree of antibody sensitization, in addition to a number of other recipient and donor factors. Postoperative outcomes and survival are very good but remain inferior to those with cardiomyopathy in most series. In conclusion, patients with end-stage biventricular congenital heart disease represent a complex group of patients for heart transplantation, and require careful evaluation and management to ensure optimal outcomes."
3,[Pregnancy and heart disease].,"Pregnancy and delivery are associated with substantial physiological changes that require adaptations in the cardiovascular system. These changes, well-tolerated in pregnant women without heart disease, expose woman with cardiovascular disease to serious risk. In fact, heart disease is the most frequent cause of maternal death, after psychiatric disorders, and the number of pregnant women with heart disease is expected to grow in the coming years. Preventing cardiovascular complications should be the main aim of every cardiologist involved in managing pregnant woman with congenital or acquired heart disease. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data which would help in the management of these patients during pregnancy and the clinical practice guidelines are often based on assumptions regarding how a specific substrate is going to respond to the physiological changes occurring due to pregnancy."
4,Biomarkers in congenital heart disease.,"The population of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) now exceeds the population of children with CHD. The long-term management of these patients relies on sequential assessment of anatomy and physiology and integration with symptoms, all targeted toward decision making around intervention. The advances in technology have vastly improved our assessment of anatomy and function. However, while the assessment of chronic heart failure in acquired heart disease has been revolutionized by the proven utility of cardiac biomarkers, their use in adult CHD is still being assessed."
5,Acquired heart disease in children is not necessarily rheumatic.,"Acquired heart diseases (AHD) cause significant morbidity and mortality in children. There are limited studies on their burden in children. We conducted a retrospective study of 85 consecutive children diagnosed with AHD using clinical evaluation and echocardiography at Medical College, Kanpur, India to determine the aetiology and outcome of AHD in children. We found rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in one-third, cardiomyopathies or myocarditis combined in a further third and the remaining third were other causes, including pericardial diseases and metabolic or genetic disorders. These latter diseases were frequently misdiagnosed, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Hence, in children of all age groups presenting with unexplained shock, dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and ascites, cardiac status should be carefully and critically evaluated so that non-rheumatic AHD may not be missed."
6,Heart disease in women.,"Women face a disparity in the evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease, even though coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. Primary care physicians play an important role in the identification and treatment of risk factors and comorbidities. It is their obligation to ensure that women receive equal and appropriate care, and to advocate for their patients."
7,Cancer in heart disease patients: what are the limitations in the treatment strategy?,"Cardiovascular disease and cancer are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and can both be present in one patient. In patients with simultaneous disease, the most threatening disease should be treated first. This is usually heart disease, but this can pose specific problems. If percutaneous coronary intervention is preferred, bleeding and thrombotic tendencies have to be taken into account in the subsequent treatment of the malignancy. With coronary artery bypass grafting, the advantages and disadvantages of one- or two-stage procedures, and the use of extracorporeal circulation have to be balanced. Development of heart disease after treatment of malignancy could be due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The effects of these cancer treatments have to be taken into account for the treatment options of the heart disease and the postoperative prognosis."
8,Cardiac Rehabilitation for Women.,"Cardiac rehabilitation provides comprehensive secondary prevention services and improves outcomes among patients with coronary heart disease, systolic heart failure, and other cardiac rehabilitation indications. Worldwide, cardiac rehabilitation services are underutilized. Underutilization is more common among women than in men. This chapter reviews barriers to referral, enrollment, and adherence among women and potential interventions to improve women's participation in cardiac rehabilitation. Gender similarities and differences in clinical, behavioral, and health outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation are addressed, and gaps in the evidence base are discussed, pointing to areas of future research."
9,Proteomics of heart disease.,"Heart diseases resulting in heart failure are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The underlying molecular causes of cardiac dysfunction in most heart diseases are still largely unknown, but are likely to result from underlying alterations in gene and protein expression. Proteomics now allows us to examine global alterations in protein expression in the diseased heart and will provide new insights into cellular mechanisms involved in cardiac dysfunction and should also result in the generation of new diagnostic and therapeutic markers. In this article we review the current status of proteomic technologies and describe how these are being applied to studies of human heart disease."
