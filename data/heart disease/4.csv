0,The impact of depression in heart disease.,"Depression and heart disease affect millions of people worldwide. Studies have shown that depression is a significant risk factor for new heart disease and that it increases morbidity and mortality in established heart disease. Many hypothesized and studied mechanisms have linked depression and heart disease, including serotonergic pathway and platelet dysfunction, inflammation, autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis imbalance, and psychosocial factors. Although the treatment of depression in cardiac patients has been shown to be safe and modestly efficacious, it has yet to translate into reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding the impact and mechanisms behind the association of depression and heart disease may allow for the development of treatments aimed at altering the devastating consequences caused by these comorbid illnesses."
1,Pulmonary Hypertension in Left Heart Disease.,"Pulmonary hypertension is common in left heart disease and is related most commonly to passive back transmission of elevated left atrial pressures. Some patients, however, may develop pulmonary vascular remodeling superimposed on their left-sided heart disease. This review provides a contemporary appraisal of existing criteria to diagnose a precapillary component to pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease as well as discusses etiologies, management issues, and future directions."
2,Expression and function of microRNAs in heart disease.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful, recently recognized regulators of gene expression. miRNAs modulate virtually all aspects of cardiac biology, from cardiac specification and development to cardiomyocyte survival and hypertrophy. Expression profiling of experimental and human heart disease has shown that miRNA expression is altered in heart disease, and miRNA expression signatures may be useful biomarkers for heart disease diagnosis and prognosis. Mechanistic studies have revealed how miRNAs contribute to heart disease pathogenesis. Here we review the expression and function of miRNAs in heart disease."
3,Embryology of the heart and its impact on understanding fetal and neonatal heart disease.,"Heart development is a complex process during which the heart needs to transform from a single tube towards a fully septated heart with four chambers and a separated outflow tract. Several major events contribute to this process, that largely overlap in time. Abnormal heart development results in congenital heart disease, which has an estimated incidence of 1% of liveborn children. Eighty percent of cases of congenital heart disease are considered to have a multifactoral developmental background, whereas knowledge of monogenetic causes for congenital heart disease is still limited. This review focuses on several novel findings in cardiac development that might enhance our knowledge of aetiology and support refinement of prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease."

5,Heart disease in diabetes mellitus.,"The spectrum of heart disease in diabetic patients is broad and complex. This article discusses the epidemiologic associations between the two causes. It attempts to summarize the effects of diabetes at the cellular, vascular, and myocardial levels. The clinical manifestations are explored, and the treatment of heart disease as it pertains to diabetic patients is discussed."
6,Diabetic heart disease.,"The fact that a significant proportion of diabetics die of heart disease has led to the belief that the excess mortality is due to coronary athersclerosis, yet many risk factors for the latter are common to diabetics and non-diabetics. In fact, heart disease in diabetes is not synonymous with coronary heart disease. There is evidence that heart disease in diabetes includes a variable combination of coronary atheroma, cardiomyopathy, micro-angiopathy and autonomioc neuropathy."
7,"Heart disease mortality in women: racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities.","Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women. The recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) landmark document, Women and Heart Disease: An Atlas of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortality, identifies the relationship between geography, race, ethnicity, gender, and the determinants of mortality. Overwhelming evidence supports that African American women, especially those residing in the South, experience higher heart disease death rates than women of other ethnic, racial, and geographic origins. This publication presents a unique opportunity for health care providers to use derived county-specific data in education, research, and provision of health promotion and disease prevention services to all women."
8,"Radiation induced heart disease: Pathogenesis, management and review literature.","Radiation therapy (RT) is a very important part of multimodality cancer therapy. Addition of RT improves survival in many cancers, but there are some accompaniments of radiation. One of them is radiation induced heart disease (RIHD). RT for mediastinal lymphoma, breast, lung and oesophageal cancer is associated with the development of RIHD. The problem can be intensified with the addition of chemotherapy. Therapeutic modalities for RIHD are the same as in the non-irradiated population. However, surgery may be difficult in the irradiated patients. The long latent period is the reason why RIHD is not extensively studied. Survival of cancer patients has improved over past few decades, so RIHD is a growing concern especially in younger patients. In this review article, we have discussed the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and management of RIHD along with impact of chemotherapeutic agents."
