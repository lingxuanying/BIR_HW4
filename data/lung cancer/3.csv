1,Multilevel Opportunities to Address Lung Cancer Stigma across the Cancer Control Continuum.,"The public health imperative to reduce the burden of lung cancer has seen unprecedented progress in recent years. Fully realizing the advances in lung cancer treatment and control requires attention to potential barriers in their momentum and implementation. In this analysis, we present and evaluate the argument that stigma is a highly significant barrier to fulfilling the clinical promise of advanced care and reduced lung cancer burden. This evaluation of the stigma of lung cancer is based on a multilevel perspective that incorporates the individual, persons in the individual's immediate environment, the health care system, and the larger societal structure that shapes perceptions and decisions. We also consider current interventions and interventional needs within and across aspects of the lung cancer continuum, including prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. Current evidence suggests that stigma detrimentally affects psychosocial, communication, and behavioral outcomes over the entire lung cancer control continuum and across multiple levels. Interventional efforts to alleviate stigma in the context of lung cancer show promise, yet more work is needed to evaluate their impact. Understanding and addressing the multilevel role of stigma is a crucial area for future study to realize the full benefits offered by lung cancer prevention, control, and treatment. Coordinated, interdisciplinary, and well-conceptualized efforts have the potential to reduce the barrier of stigma in the context of lung cancer and facilitate demonstrable improvements in clinical care and quality of life."
2,"Understanding the Links Between Lung Cancer, COPD, and Emphysema: A Key to More Effective Treatment and Screening.","Lung cancer has been linked to the changes in lung function characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to the changes in lung morphology seen in emphysema. It seems that a common thread of smoking-induced lung injury can be traced to all three diseases. However, the association is not as straightforward as it may seem; for example, even never-smokers with emphysema have an increased risk of lung cancer. Whether lung cancer, COPD, and emphysema are linked by common genes, mechanisms, causes, or a combination thereof, understanding the associations between them has become a priority for research regarding tobacco-related illnesses. A better delineation of the relationships between these three entities may lead to significant improvements in the effectiveness of lung cancer screening programs, and to reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with these deadly diseases."
3,Lung cancer in China: current and prospect.,"Purpose of review: To describe the current status of lung cancer in China, including incidence, prevention, molecular testing and treatment. Recent findings: Lung cancer presents a major public health issue and an enormous burden on society in China, because of its increasing incidence and high mortality. Several distinct gene profiles were associated with lung cancer in China: high EGFR mutation rate, low KRAS mutation rate and more comorbidity of HBV infection. Thus, local Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines with more consideration of drug accessibility, regional development differences were highly recommended for clinical practice. For treatment, targeted therapy has achieved fruitful progress. Immunotherapy in China was a little bit lag behind previously and now there is a surge of immunotherapeutic drugs under investigation. For future, more preventive strategies and more trials considering chrematistics of Chinese lung cancer are needed. Summary: There are achievements and shortcomings for lung cancer prevention and treatment in China. More work considering distinct characteristic of lung caner in China are needed."
4,"Lung cancer: needs assessment, treatment and therapies.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Globally, the annual diagnosis rate of new cases is approximately 1.6 million. The latest figures for the UK show that there are approximately 39000 cases each year and that lung cancer accounts for about 22% of all cancer deaths (Cancer Research UK, 2013a). This article will look at the latest national recommendations for managing and treating non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 80% of lung cancers, as well as emerging therapies. It is not within the scope of this article to discuss each type and aspect of lung cancer in detail and further reading is encouraged."
5,"Lung cancer and miRNAs: a possible remedy for anti-metastatic, therapeutic and diagnostic applications.","Lung cancer still accounts for the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and despite the emerging advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques it remains to be a serious global public health concern. Micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are responsible for invasion and metastasis of various tumors including lung cancer which underscores the necessity of understanding their functions. Areas covered: Herein, we aim to summarize the recent advances made in our understanding of the miRNAs with special reference to lung cancer. Moreover, the role of miRNAs in crucial cellular processes will be elucidated. Various applications of the miRNAs would be explained and different kinds of them would be discussed to delineate their significance in lung cancer biology, therapy and diagnosis. Expert commentary: the miRNA study in the field of respiratory disease and specially lung cancer has emerged lately. Given the several miRNAs, which are in the clinical trials, this field is passing through its maturation phase which ultimately could rise to a robust tool for lung cancer therapy, diagnosis and prevention."
6,[Research Progress on Lung Cancer Screening].,"Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world. The five-year survival rate is 19.7%, which seriously threatens human health. Lung cancer screening is an effective measure to reduce lung cancer mortality. Existing studies have shown that screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20%. Currently, lung cancer screening is recommended internationally and nationally. Studying the development status of lung cancer screening helps us to identify the high-risk groups of lung cancer, explore reasonable screening programs, improve the cost-effectiveness of screening and reduce the economic burden. Therefore, this article summarizes the current status of lung cancer screening, the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening and the existing problems as follows. ."
7,Next Generation of Lung Cancer Management.,"The most important lung cancer research falls under the hub of personalized medicine. There is an expanding list of lung cancer genotypes that researchers have identified as relevant, and even more importantly, that they have discovered targeted therapies for. In addition, scientists are learning more about predictive markers for immunotherapy that may inform clinicians on how to optimally treat patients. Both targeted therapy and immunotherapy are approved in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and oncologists are learning more about the utility for these drugs in earlier stage disease."
8,[Research Advance in Anti-lung Cancer Mechanism of Metformin].,"Metformin, as a first-line drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has been proved to be safe and effective. In recent years, epidemiological studies have found that metformin can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer cells, and is expected to become a new anti-lung cancer drug. Lung cancer is a disease that seriously endangers human health, its morbidity and mortality have been ranked first among all malignant tumors, and the prognosis is poor. In recent years, a great deal of evidence shows that metformin can reduce the risk and mortality of tumors such as lung cancer. Its mechanisms mainly include activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway, improving hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, promoting lung cancer cell apoptosis and inhibiting related inflammatory response. The aim of this article is to reviews the study of metformin on lung cancer."
