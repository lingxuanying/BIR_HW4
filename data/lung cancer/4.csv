0,[Lung cancer--review].,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in Iceland and the most frequent cause of cancer related deaths. Smoking is by far the most important cause but familial factors also contribute. The symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle and the diagnosis, in about 70% of cases, is made when metastases have occurred. Curative surgical treatment is therefore only possible in about a third of the cases whereas other patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In recent years some important advances have been made in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer. New imaging techniques have improved diagnosis and staging practices and consequently also treatment. Recent evidence suggests that screening with low dose CT may improve survival. New approaches to chemotherapy have been shown to improve survival and well being of patients with advanced disease. Chemotherapeutic agents are now being used in conjunction with surgery to reduce the risk of tumour spread. Furthermore, advances in surgical techniques have made resections possible in cases deemed inoperable in the past. In this review we present important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer as reflected by recent literature that should be of interest to a wide variety of specialists."
1,Critical microRNAs in Lung Cancer: Recent Advances and Potential Applications.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of various genes involved in cell growth, development and the maintenance of body homeostasis. They are closely linked to different human diseases, particularly in cancers. Amplification and overexpression of some miRNAs that are called 'oncomiRs' or down-regulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs are associated with genetic alterations that are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in humans. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high mortality rate of lung cancer is not changed even with recent advances in cancer treatment. Several studies demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer that they negatively or positively regulate gene and protein expression by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Objective: This article reviewed the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs and their target genes in lung cancer and discussed the potential use of some miRNAs as novel therapeutic agents in lung cancer. Method: Firstly, we collected and summarized all research and review and research articles in databases including Scopus and PubMed. Then, we used related keywords that are important to lung cancer target therapy and their diagnostic and prognostic values. Results: Based on collected articles and research, recognizing critical microRNA and controlling the expression of this microRNA by antagonist oligonucleotides like antagomiRs or anti-miRs and microRNA mimicking will have a remarkable role in treating lung cancer. Conclusion: Many research studies have shown that a combination of chemotherapy plus knockdown or mimicking microRNA is effective and useful in the cancers treatment like lung cancer."
2,[Research Progress of Circular RNA in Lung Cancer].,"Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its imposes an insupportable burden on patients due to its poor prognosis. The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is under great pressure. Therefore, it is urgent to explore effective therapeutic targets and molecular markers. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a kind of covalently closed non-coding RNAs, which has attracted much attention due to its conservation, stability and tissue specificity. Many studies have found that circRNA participates in the regulation of lung cancer through various mechanisms such as sponging miRNA and plays a part vital role in the early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation. In recent years, there have been numerous studies on circRNA in lung cancer. This paper summarizes the current progress of circRNA in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer. ."
3,Lung cancer.,"During the 20th century, a dramatic epidemic of lung cancer deaths has occurred in many countries. The time trends of lung cancer incidence and mortality primarily reflect patterns of cigarette smoking, the predominant risk factor, but inconsistencies are evident in international comparisons. Although the predominant role of tobacco smoking as a cause of lung cancer throughout the world is amply documented, the persistence of tobacco smoking and the continued penetration of manufactured cigarettes into new markets provide a strong reason for continuing to monitor lung cancer trends. Changes in other risk factors for lung cancer and changes in diagnostic and death certificate reporting practices may also affect trends in rates. However, our understanding of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer allows forecasting of lung cancer rates for public health planning."
4,[Mechanism and Research Progress of Microbiome in the Development of Lung Cancer].,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors with poor prognosis in China, and most patients are diagnosed as advanced patients. Studies have shown that the microecological characteristics of lung cancer patients are different from healthy people, and the microorganisms of the respiratory tract can affect the occurrence and development of lung cancer through various mechanisms. In recent years, the study of the correlation between microbiome and disease has become another research hotspot following the Human Genome Project. However, at present, there are relatively few studies on the characteristics of lung cancer and respiratory microbiome. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the potential relationship between lung cancer and microbial flora. By studying the mechanism of action of respiratory microorganisms in the development of lung cancer, it is expected to provide a clearer scientific basis in the clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis assessment of lung cancer. This article reviews the current researches on microbial flora and lung cancer, and provides new ideas for clinical diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. ."
5,Lung cancer.,"Only patients with localized lung cancer benefit from curative resection. Curative radiotherapy is recommended in patients with a resectable tumor in whom surgery is precluded for medical reasons. Adjuvant preoperative or postoperative therapy of any type does not improve the results of surgery except in patients with Pancoast tumor. Therapy for nonlocalized tumors does not affect survival. Radiotherapy has a palliative effect in 50 to 75 per cent of patients presenting with symptoms from either a primary lesion or metastases and should therefore be recommended in symptomatic patients. The palliative effect of chemotherapy is limited in lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas. However, chemotherapy alone or in association with radiotherapy produces remarkable tumor regression and some improvement of survival in small cell carcinoma. The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer is still under evaluation."
6,[Therapeutic Relevance of Human Microbiota and Lung Cancer].,"The human microbiome is closely related to human health status. Disruption of the symbiotic balance of the human microbiome is commonly found in systematic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and chronic gastric diseases. The human microbiome confers benefits or disease susceptibility to the human body through multiple pathways, associated with approximately 20% of malignancies. The incidence and mortality of lung cancer (LC) in men in China are the highest among all malignancies, which is a serious threat to human health. Emerging evidence has suggested that the human microbiota may be closely related to lung cancer at multiple levels, e.g., by affecting metabolic, inflammatory, or immune pathways. At the same time, the human microbiota affects the efficacy of lung cancer on chemoradiotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy and other treatments. Immunotherapy is a promising method for the treatment of malignancies such as lung cancer, but the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients is heterogeneous. Preclinical studies based on lung cancer cell lines suggest that the intestinal microbiota can modulate responses to anti--PD-1 therapy through interactions with the host immune system. But for lung cancer patients, whether the intestinal flora can still regulate immunotherapy remains controversial. In this mini-review, we summarize current research findings describing therapeutic relevance of human microbiota and lung cancer. A better knowledge of the interplay between the human microbiome and lung cancer may promote the development of innovative strategies for prevention and personalized treatment in lung cancer."
7,Female lung cancer.,"Female lung cancer death rates increased by more than 550 percent between 1950 and 1991. In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The lung cancer epidemic is primarily attributable to cigarette smoking, which is responsible for at least 80% of the disease in women. There are gender differences in the distribution of lung cancer by histologic type, even controlling for smoking, and some data suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level of smoking. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Family history of lung cancer, personal history of lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), and a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk. Data specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent. Finally, many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables; however, clinical trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta-carotene supplementation. Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in women, efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for reducing the female lung cancer burden."
8,[A Review of Drug Therapy of Lung Cancer with Interstitial Lung Disease].,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a risk factor for lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer associated with ILD (LC-ILD) often appear clinically. During the treatment of LC-ILD, there is a risk of causing acute exacerbation or even death in the treatment of lung cancer. At the same time, combining ILD has become the exclusion criteria for prospective clinical trials of most lung cancers. Therefore, when lung cancer is combined with ILD, it often becomes a difficult point for the treatment of lung cancer. Because LC-ILD patients have a certain proportion in the clinic, it is necessary to explore the best treatment options. Here we review the results of existing clinical studies for reference."
9,An examination of two dichotomies: Women with lung cancer and living with lung cancer as a chronic disease.,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death globally, yet with many recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, the face of the disease is shifting. Historically, lung cancer is often thought of as a predominantly male disease with more than twice as many men as women being diagnosed worldwide-mostly due to the influence of smoking as the leading risk factor. However, lung cancer is also the second leading cause of cancer death in women and there is a growing population of young women who have never smoked and are being diagnosed. The past decade has seen groundbreaking innovations in both the early detection and treatment of lung cancer. In this new era, survival rates are beginning to increase and many of those diagnosed are finding themselves in a new situation-living long term with a deadly cancer. Here, we review pertinent aspects of women and lung cancer as well as the concept of living with lung cancer as a chronic disease to give a new perspective on the changing face of lung cancer treatment and care."
