0,[Minimally Invasive Therapies for Early Stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the world, among which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of the total lung cancer. With the widespread of computed tomography (CT) and other imaging screening methods, the pathological types of lung cancer have changed from central squamous cell carcinoma to the early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, which is manifested as isolated pulmonary nodules and ground glass nodules on CT. Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is of crucial clinical significance, and the continuous development and improvement of minimally invasive interventional techniques provide more options for lung cancer treatment, such as stereotactic radiation, percutaneous ablation, and bronchial intervention. This paper will make a review on the principle, advantages, disadvantages and prospects of minimally invasive interventional therapy commonly used in clinical practice."
1,Lung cancer in never smokers.,"Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is the seventh leading cause of death among solid tumors. The main risk factor for lung cancer is smoking; however, approximately 15% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. LCINS is more frequent in women, irrespective of geographical location, nevertheless, the highest incidence has been found in South-East Asia. The histological incidence of adenocarcinoma is higher in the group of never smokers than squamous cell carcinoma. There is a familial clustering of lung cancer that is more pronounced in never smokers, where the family history was associated with an increased risk. Genome-wide association studies identified certain chromosomal aberrations in LCINS. Furthermore, the oncogenic mutation pattern is distinct in nonsmoking patients: activating mutations of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase are more frequent. The etiology of LCINS includes several environmental factors as well, such as environmental tobacco smoke, viral and hormonal factors, a variety of pulmonary diseases and certain occupational exposures. It is now established that EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (erlotinib and geftinib) in lung cancer is more effective in LCINS, owing to the higher incidence of EGFR mutation in nonsmokers. Despite the growing body of information on LCINS in recent years there is a need to further investigate the pathogenesis of this particular lung cancer. Future studies on LCINS should try to tackle the issues of prevention, early diagnosis and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets to combat lung cancer disease."
2,[Research Progress of Tumor-Associated Neutrophils and Lung Cancer].,"Lung cancer is a global disease with high morbidity and mortality, which seriously affects human health. The long-term existence of chronic pulmonary inflammation is closely related to the occurrence and development of lung cancer, neutrophils are not only involved in acute and chronic inflammation, but also in the composition of tumor microenvironment (TME), which is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors. Recent studies have found that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play an important role in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. This article reviews the role, mechanism and clinical significance of tumor-related neutrophils in lung cancer."
3,Low-dose computed tomography screening reduces lung cancer mortality.,"Lung cancer causes an estimated 1.6 million deaths each year, being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Late diagnosis and, in some cases, the high aggressiveness of the tumour result in low overall five-year survival rates of 12% among men and 7% among women. The cure is most likely in early-stage disease. The poor outcomes of treatment in lung cancer resulting from the fact that most cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage of the disease justify the implementation of an optimal lung cancer prevention in the form of smoking cessation and screening programmes that would offer a chance to detect early stages of the disease, while fitting within specific economic constraints. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) - the largest and most expensive randomised, clinical trial in the USA demonstrated a 20% mortality rate reduction in patients who had undergone chest low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, as compared to patients screened with a conventional chest X-ray. Results of the NLST enabled the implementation of lung cancer screening programme among highrisk patients in the USA and parts of China. In 2017, recommendations of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons also strongly recommend an implementation of a screening programme in the EU. Further studies of improved lung cancer risk assessment scores and of effective molecular markers should intensify in order to reduce all potential harms to the high-risk group and to increase cost-effectiveness of the screening."
4,Lung cancer and women.,"In the early 1900s, lung cancer was a rare malignancy in women, but starting from the 1960s it has progressively reached epidemic proportions, surpassing breast cancer in 1987 and becoming the leading cause of cancer deaths in many countries. Retrospective data show that the 5-year survival rate for women who have lung cancer is 15.6%, compared with 12.5% for men, and this improved survival could have important implications in the design and interpretation of lung cancer trials. Women have major responses to therapy regardless of stage, therapeutic modalities or histology. The increase of lung cancer incidence among women is reflected in their clinical trial participation, causing a survival improvement and suggesting the need of stratification by sex in future studies. No specific drugs for women with lung cancer are currently available, but researchers are devoting energies in this area in order to better understand the implication of gender differences in epidemiology, pathogenesis, prognosis and tumor response."
5,Lung cancer. Introduction.,A series of review articles on lung cancer beginning in this issue of Thorax aims to increase the awareness of up to date evidence based knowledge and to generate further interest and optimism in its diagnosis and management.
6,[The Effects and Management of Viral Pneumonia on Lung Cancer Patients].,"The worldwide epidemic of three coronaviruses and one influenza virus in 21st century have seriously threatened human health. Infection with these viruses can cause respiratory symptoms. The patients with lung cancer are more susceptible to viral infection and have a worse prognosis due to the advanced age and the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy itself and the anticancer treatments. In addition, without sufficient clinical awareness, a missed diagnosis of viral pneumonia may occur due to the fever and respiratory symptoms caused by lung cancer and its secondary diseases. Furthermore, control measures against viral outbreaks may interfere with routine diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients. Therefore, scientific protection and individualized management of lung cancer patients are particularly important during virus epidemic prevention and control. Here, we systematically reviewed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of viral pneumonia, its impact on patients with lung cancer and the differential diagnosis of lung cancer-related respiratory manifestations, aiming to provide guidance for the individual management of lung cancer patients during the prevention and control of viral pneumonia epidemic."
7,Lung cancer screening: the European perspective.,"European studies have contributed significantly to the understanding of lung cancer screening. Smoking within screening, quality of life, nodule management, minimally invasive treatments, cancer prevention programs, and risk models have been extensively investigated by European groups. Mortality data from European screening studies have not been encouraging so far, but long-term results of the NELSON study are eagerly awaited. Investigations on molecular markers of lung cancer are ongoing in Europe; preliminary results suggest they may become an important screening tool in the future."
8,Lung cancer biomarkers in exhaled breath.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Methods for early detection of lung cancer, such as computerized tomography scanning technology, often discover a large number of small lung nodules, posing a new problem to radiologists and chest physicians. The vast majority of these nodules will be benign, but there is currently no easy way to determine which nodules represent very early lung cancer. Adjuvant testing with PET imaging and nonsurgical biopsies has a low yield for these small indeterminate nodules, carries potential morbidity and is costly. Indeed, purely morphological criteria seem to be insufficient for distinguishing lung cancer from benign nodules at early stages with sufficient confidence, therefore false positives undergoing surgical resection frequently occur. A molecular approach to the diagnosis of lung cancer through the analysis of exhaled breath could greatly improve the specificity of imaging procedures. A biomarker-driven approach to signs or symptoms possibly due to lung cancer would represent a complementary tool aimed at ruling out (with known error probability) rather than diagnosing lung cancer. Volatile and nonvolatile components of the breath are being studied as biomarkers of lung cancer. Breath testing is noninvasive and potentially inexpensive. There is promise that an accurate lung cancer breath biomarker, capable of being applied clinically, will be developed in the near future. In this article, we summarize some of the rationale for breath biomarker development, review the published literature in this field and provide thoughts regarding future directions."
9,[Research Progress on the Relationship between Blood Lipids and Lung Cancer Risk and Prognosis].,"In recent years, lung cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. There is increasing evidence that many lipids and lipid analogs are key regulators of tumorigenesis, and factors that affect blood lipid levels such as smoking, diet, and obesity may be associated with cancer risk. With the deepening of research on the relationship between lipids and tumorigenesis, exploring the correlation between blood lipids and lung cancer risk and prognosis has become a research hotspot. This article reviews the research progress of the relationship between blood lipid levels and the risk of lung cancer, blood lipid levels and the prognosis of lung cancer patients, and the adjustment of blood lipid drugs and the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. ."
