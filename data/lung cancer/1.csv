0,Lung cancer in persons with HIV.,"Purpose of review: Lung cancer is emerging as a leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons. This review will discuss the latest scientific evidence regarding the mechanisms driving lung cancer risk in HIV infection, the clinical presentation of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons and recent data regarding the outcomes, treatment and prevention of lung cancer in this group. Recent findings: Increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons is primarily due to higher smoking rates, but emerging evidence also implicates immunosuppression and inflammatory processes. Lung cancer outcomes may be worse in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral era, but this may stem, in part, from treatment disparities. Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed tomography (CT) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general population, and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in HIV-infected smokers. Summary: Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV infection. It is associated with unique HIV-related causal mechanisms, and may be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV-infected persons. Smoking cessation and early cancer detection with chest CT are likely to benefit HIV-infected smokers."
1,Recent advances in the management of lung cancer.,"Historically, the prognosis for individuals diagnosed with lung cancer has been bleak. However, the past 10 years have seen important advances in treatment and diagnosis which have translated into the first improvements seen in lung cancer survival. This review highlights the major advances in treatments with curative intent, systemic targeted therapies, palliative care and early diagnosis in lung cancer. We discuss the pivotal research that underpins these new technologies/strategies and their current position in clinical practice."
2,Epidemiology of Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer continues to be one of the most common causes of cancer death despite understanding the major cause of the disease: cigarette smoking. Smoking increases lung cancer risk 5- to 10-fold with a clear dose-response relationship. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among nonsmokers increases lung cancer risk about 20%. Risks for marijuana and hookah use, and the new e-cigarettes, are yet to be consistently defined and will be important areas for continued research as use of these products increases. Other known environmental risk factors include exposures to radon, asbestos, diesel, and ionizing radiation. Host factors have also been associated with lung cancer risk, including family history of lung cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infections. Studies to identify genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility have consistently identified chromosomal regions on 15q25, 6p21 and 5p15 associated with lung cancer risk. Risk prediction models for lung cancer typically include age, sex, cigarette smoking intensity and/or duration, medical history, and occupational exposures, however there is not yet a risk prediction model currently recommended for general use. As lung cancer screening becomes more widespread, a validated model will be needed to better define risk groups to inform screening guidelines."
3,Heterogeneity in Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer diagnosis is a challenge since it is also one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers. Diagnostic challenges are deeply related to the development of personalized therapy and molecular and precise histological characterizations of lung cancer. When addressing these features, it is very important to acknowledge the issue of tumour heterogeneity, as it imposes several questions. First of all, lung cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, at a cellular and histological level. Cellular and histological heterogeneity are addressed with emphasis on the diagnosis, pre-neoplastic lesions, and cell origin, trying to contribute to a better knowledge of carcinogenesis. Molecular intra-tumour and inter-tumour heterogeneity are also addressed as temporal heterogeneity. Lung cancer heterogeneity has implications in pathogenesis understanding, diagnosis, selection of tissue for molecular diagnosis, as well as therapeutic decision. The understanding of tumour heterogeneity is crucial and we must be aware of the implications and future developments regarding this field."
4,Diagnosis and Molecular Classification of Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is a complex disease composed of diverse histological and molecular types with clinical relevance. The advent of large-scale molecular profiling has been helpful to identify novel molecular targets that can be applied to the treatment of particular lung cancer patients and has helped to reshape the pathological classification of lung cancer. Novel directions include the immunotherapy revolution, which has opened the door for new opportunities for cancer therapy and is also redefining the classification of multiple tumors, including lung cancer. In the present chapter, we will review the main current basis of the pathological diagnosis and classification of lung cancer incorporating the histopathological and molecular dimensions of the disease."
5,Epidemiology of Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer has been transformed from a rare disease into a global problem and public health issue. The etiologic factors of lung cancer become more complex along with industrialization, urbanization, and environmental pollution around the world. Currently, the control of lung cancer has attracted worldwide attention. Studies on the epidemiologic characteristics of lung cancer and its relative risk factors have played an important role in the tertiary prevention of lung cancer and in exploring new ways of diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the current evolution of the epidemiology of lung cancer."
6,Lung Cancer in Never Smokers.,"Lung cancer is predominantly associated with cigarette smoking; however, a substantial minority of patients with the disease have never smoked. In the US it is estimated there are 17,000-26,000 annual deaths from lung cancer in never smokers, which as a separate entity would be the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality. Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology of lung cancer in never smokers and in comparison to lung cancer in smokers appears less complex with a higher likelihood to have targetable driver mutations."
7,"Lung cancer screening: advantages, controversies, and applications.","Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) have shown that low-dose computed tomography (CT) is capable of detecting lung neoplasms in individuals at high risk. However, whether it is advantageous to perform lung cancer screening on these patients is a significant concern, as are the potential adverse outcomes from screening. Methods: A review of several randomized clinical trials, focusing on the NLST, was undertaken. Adverse outcomes and costs related to lung cancer screening were also examined. Results: Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT in high-risk individuals reduced lung cancer deaths by more than 20% when compared with those screened by chest radiography. False-positive results were seen in both groups, but the number of adverse events from the screening test and subsequent diagnostic procedures was low. Conclusions: Lung cancer screening is controversial, but the NLST has demonstrated that such testing may reduce lung cancer deaths in high-risk individuals when performed with low-dose CT rather than chest radiography. Guidelines should be established to not only help identify an appropriate screening population, but also develop standards for radiological testing."
8,Surgical Treatment of Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death and the second most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Surgical intervention is most applicable to early-stage lung cancer diagnoses and considered the best curative option. Multiple surgical techniques are now available, including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy. Robotics and video-assistance are commonly used in wedge resection and sometimes used for segmentectomy. Regardless of the technique, focused clinical management of the patient following lung cancer surgery by nurses and nurse practitioners remains a priority. Future innovations affecting the surgical treatment of lung cancer include immunotherapy and oncogenomics."
9,Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is the world's leading cause of cancer death. Screening for lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography improves mortality. Various modalities exist for diagnosis and staging. Treatment is determined by subtype and stage of cancer; there are several personalized therapies that did not exist just a few years ago. Caring for the patient with lung cancer is a complex task. This review provides a broad outline of this disease, helping clinicians identify such patients and familiarizing them with lung cancer care options, so they are better equipped to guide their patients along this challenging journey."
