0,Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis and renal replacement therapy: a critical review.,"Rhabdomyolysis, a clinical syndrome caused by damage to skeletal muscle and release of its breakdown products into the circulation, can be followed by acute kidney injury (AKI) as a severe complication. The belief that the AKI is triggered by myoglobin as the toxin responsible appears to be oversimplified. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis and following AKI could widen treatment options, leading to preservation of the kidney: the decision to initiate renal replacement therapy in clinical practice should not be made on the basis of the myoglobin or creatine phosphokinase serum concentrations."
1,Pediatric Acute Kidney Injury.,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in children is a serious condition with an important impact on morbidity and mortality. Onset can be insidious and it is frequently unrecognized in the early phase when the therapeutic opportunities are theoretically more effective. Summary: The present review focuses on the most recent epidemiology studies and the progress in pediatric AKI (pAKI) research. Standardization of definition (presented in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) and novel biomarkers have been developed to help clinicians recognize kidney injury in a timely manner, both in adult and pediatric populations. Strengths and weaknesses of these diagnostic tools are discussed and the clinical scoring system (Renal Angina Index), which aims to provide a rational context for biomarker utilization, is also presented. Even if effective treatments are not currently available for established AKI, specific preventive approaches and some promising pharmacological treatments will be detailed. Renal replacement therapy is currently considered the most effective way to manage fluid balance when severe AKI occurs. Key Messages: Great efforts in pAKI research have today led to new strategies for early AKI detection and prevention strategies. Further studies have to be conducted in the next future in order to definitely improve the outcomes of pediatric patients experiencing this deadly syndrome."
2,Biomarkers of renal recovery after acute kidney injury.,"Novel biomarkers can be suitable for early acute kidney injury diagnosis and the prediction of the need for dialysis. It remains unclear whether such biomarkers may also play a role in the prediction of recovery after established acute kidney injury or in aiding the decision of when to stop renal support therapy. PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for studies that reported on the epidemiology of renal recovery after acute kidney injury, the risk factors of recovery versus non-recovery after acute kidney injury, and potential biomarkers of acute kidney injury recovery. The reference lists of these articles and relevant review articles were also reviewed. Final references were selected for inclusion in the review based on their relevance. New biomarkers exhibited a potential role in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury recovery. Urine HGF, IGFBP-7, TIMP-2 and NGAL may improve our ability to predict the odds and timing of recovery and eventually renal support withdrawal. Acute kidney injury recovery requires more study, and its definition needs to be standardized to allow for better and more powerful research on biomarkers because some of them show potential for the prediction of acute kidney injury recovery."
3,Acute kidney injury in pregnancy.,"Purpose of review: Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (Pr-AKI) is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and remains a large public health problem. Recent findings: Pr-AKI incidence has globally decreased over time for the most part. However, the cause presents a disparity between developing and developed countries, reflecting differences in socioeconomic factors and healthcare infrastructure - with the noteworthy outlier of increased incidence in the United States and Canada. Although Pr-AKI can be secondary to conditions affecting the general population, in most cases it is pregnancy specific. Septic abortion, hyperemesis gravidarum, and hemorrhage have become less prevalent with access to healthcare but are being displaced by thrombotic microangiopathies, such as preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and pregnancy-associated hemolytic-uremic syndromes, as well as acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Understanding these conditions plays a pivotal role in the timely diagnosis and enhancement of therapeutic approaches. Summary: In this review, we focus on the renal physiology of the pregnancy, epidemiology, and specific conditions known to cause Pr-AKI, summarizing diagnostic definition, insights in pathophysiology, clinical considerations, and novel treatment approaches, thus providing the reader a framework of clinically relevant information for interdisciplinary management."
4,Acute Kidney Injury in Pregnancy.,"Acute kidney injury in pregnancy is a public health problem and a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The incidence of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury has increased in the developed countries, theorized to be the result of an increase in pregnancies in advanced maternal age, and continues to remain higher in developing countries owing to inadequate antenatal care. While hyperemesis gravidarum is a common cause of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury during the first trimester, complications such as preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic uremic syndrome are important causes of acute kidney injury later in the pregnancy. Diagnosis of pregnancy-related acute kidney injury can be difficult owing to lack of diagnostic criteria and overlapping clinical features between various causes. General measures to treat pregnancy-related acute kidney injury include identification of the underlying cause of kidney injury, intravenous fluid resuscitation, timely initiation of dialysis if needed, and prompt fetal delivery, if necessary. Specific treatment includes steroid and immunosuppressive therapy for glomerulonephritis; prompt delivery for severe preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy; and plasmapheresis and eculizumab for thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome."
5,Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management.,"Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes."
6,Paradigms of acute kidney injury in the intensive care setting.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, variable pathogenesis and diverse outcomes. However, these heterogeneities are not reflected in current approaches to the diagnosis and, to some degree, treatment of AKI. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in serum creatinine level and urine output (parameters that are used to define AKI); however, they differ vastly in their physiological contexts and demand completely opposite treatments. AKI is often still considered to be a homogeneous clinical entity, which implies a uniform pathogenesis and a well-defined prognosis. As a consequence, efforts to find effective AKI treatments have been hampered by a lack of clear clinical classifications for various types of AKI. In addition, subclassification of AKI into subclinical phenotypes - for example, on the basis of protein biomarkers and other in vitro diagnostics that take into account disease aetiology and underlying pathogenesis - might be necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively target the widely differing pathomechanisms of AKI. In this Review, we discuss the major subtypes of AKI that are associated with sepsis, major surgery, renal hypoperfusion and nephrotoxin exposure -situations that are typically seen in the intensive care setting. We consider differences and similarities in their phenotype, pathogenesis and outcomes and how this information might be used to guide treatment."
7,Acute Kidney Injury in the Critically Ill Patient: A Current Review of the Literature.,"Purpose: A comprehensive review of the literature to provide a focused and thorough update on the issue of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the surgical patient. Methods: A PubMed and Medline search was performed and keywords included AKI, renal failure, critically ill, and renal replacement therapy (RRT). Principal findings: A common clinical problem encountered in critically ill patients is AKI. The recent consensus definitions for the diagnosis and classification of AKI (ie, Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease/Acute Kidney Injury Network) have enabled us to standardize the severity of AKI and facilitate strategies for prevention. These strategies as well as treatment modalities of AKI are discussed. We provide a concise overview of the issue of renal failure. We describe strategies for prevention including types of fluids used for resuscitation, timing of initiation of RRT, and different treatment modalities currently available for clinical practice. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury is a common problem in the critically ill patient and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. A standardized definition and staging system has led to improved diagnosis and understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. There are many trials leading to improved prevention and management of the disease."
8,Understanding and preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury.,"Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) occurs in up to 30% of patients who receive iodinated contrast media and is generally considered to be the third most common cause of hospital-acquired AKI. Accurate assessment of the incidence of CIAKI is obscured, however, by the use of various definitions for diagnosis, the different populations studied and the prophylactic measures put in place. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie CIAKI is required to enable reliable risk assessment for individual patients, as their medical histories will determine the specific pathways by which contrast media administration might lead to kidney damage. Here, we highlight common triggers that prompt the development of CIAKI and the subsequent mechanisms that ultimately cause kidney damage. We also discuss effective protective measures, such as rapidly acting oral hydration schemes and loop diuretics, in the context of CIAKI pathophysiology. Understanding of how CIAKI arises in different patient groups could enable a marked reduction in incidence and improved outcomes. The ultimate goal is to shape CIAKI prevention strategies for individual patients."
9,Acute Kidney Injury Following Cardiothoracic Surgery.,"This article reviews acute kidney injury following cardiothoracic surgery, addressing the full spectrum of the perioperative environment including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors for acute kidney injury. Topics discussed include pathophysiology, risk prediction scoring, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and new directions for research."
