1,Acute kidney injury and disease: Long-term consequences and management.,"With increasing longevity and the presence of multiple comorbidities, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients, and an even larger population in the community, is at increased risk of developing an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI). Because of improvements in short-term outcomes following an episode of AKI, survivors of an episode of AKI are now predisposed to develop its long-term sequel. The identification of risk for progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complicated by the absence of good biomarkers that identify this risk and the variability of risk associated with clinical factors including, but not limited to, the number of AKI episodes, severity, duration of previous AKI and pre-existing CKD that has made the prediction for long-term outcomes in survivors of AKI more difficult. Being a significant contributor to the growing incidence of CKD, there is a need to implement measures to prevent AKI in both the community and hospital settings, target interventions to treat AKI that are also associated with better long-term outcomes, accurately identify patients at risk of adverse consequences following an episode of AKI and institute therapeutic strategies to improve these long-term outcomes. We discuss the lasting renal and non-renal consequences following an episode of AKI, available biomarkers and non-invasive testing to identify ongoing intra-renal pathology and review the currently available and future treatment strategies to help reduce these adverse long-term outcomes."
2,Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury: pathophysiology and diagnostic modalities and management.,"Acute kidney injury is a disease spectrum that can present with from mild renal dysfunction to complete renal failure that would require renal replacement therapy. Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury is a complication that carries a grave disease burden. Risk factors are identified as being either modifiable or non-modifiable. This literature review aims to define the pathophysiology of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury, the current definition and classification of acute kidney injury and the available diagnostic modalities, especially the use of biomarkers."
3,Acute kidney injury in pregnancy including renal disease diagnosed in pregnancy.,"Pregnancy-related acute kidney injury (AKI) is a rare but serious complication in high-income settings and remains an important cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income settings. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the leading cause of pregnancy-related AKI worldwide. In this article, we outline the epidemiology, aetiology, recognition, investigation and management of pregnancy-related AKI. Difficulties in the definition of AKI, approaches to determine the cause of AKI in diagnostically challenging circumstances and diagnosis of new renal disease in pregnancy are discussed."
4,Prerenal acute kidney injury-still a relevant term in modern clinical practice?,"The traditional taxonomy of acute kidney injury (AKI) has remained pervasive in clinical nephrology. While the terms 'prerenal', 'intrarenal' and 'postrenal' highlight the diverse pathophysiology underlying AKI, they also imply discrete disease pathways and de-emphasize the nature of AKI as an evolving clinical syndrome with multiple, often simultaneous and overlapping, causes. In a similar vein, prerenal AKI comprises a diverse spectrum of kidney disorders, albeit one that is often managed by using a standardized clinical algorithm. We contend that the term 'prerenal' is too vague to adequately convey our current understanding of hypoperfusion-related AKI and that it should thus be avoided in the clinical setting. Practice patterns among nephrologists indicate that AKI-related terminology plays a significant role in the approaches that clinicians take to patients that have this complex disease. Thus, it appears that precise terminology does impact the treatment that patients receive. We will outline differences in the diagnosis and management of clinical conditions lying on the so-called prerenal disease spectrum to advocate caution when administering intravenous fluids to these clinically decompensated patients. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may, thus, avert clinical missteps such as fluid and vasopressor mismanagement in tenuous or critically ill patients."

6,Acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery.,"Purpose of review: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a long-recognized complication of cardiac surgery. It is a commonly encountered clinical syndrome that, in its most severe form, increases the odds of operative mortality three to eight-fold. The pathogenesis of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is complex. No single intervention is likely to provide a panacea, and thus, the purpose of this review is to assess the wide breadth of emerging research into potential strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat CSA-AKI. Recent findings: Research in the field of CSA-AKI published within the last 18 months adds further layers of knowledge to many previously studied areas. These include its definition (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease, Acute Kidney Injury Network, and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria), diagnosis (biomarkers and intraoperative renal oximetry), prevention (statin therapy, acetylsalicylic acid, N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, off-pump coronary revascularization, goal-directed hemodynamic therapy, and minimizing blood transfusion), and treatment (early initiation of renal replacement therapy). Summary: Although there has been much high-quality research conducted in this field in recent years, preventing CSA-AKI by avoiding renal insults remains the mainstay of management. Although biomarkers have the potential to diagnose CSA-AKI at an earlier stage, efficacious interventions to treat established CSA-AKI remain elusive."
7,Acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) - an abrupt deterioration in renal function - causes a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) or fall in urine output. It is common, occurring in up to 20% of hospital admissions. Importantly, even small rises in SCr are associated with increased risk of death and longer hospital stays. A 2009 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report found that a proportion of AKI in secondary care was avoidable. In addition, management of established AKI was 'good' less than half the time. In practice, AKI represents a heterogeneous group of conditions, encompassing impairments in both kidney structure and function. Delivering disease-specific treatment early in the course of AKI may improve outcomes. The provision of best-practice care for all will rely on a better understanding of risk, and frameworks of care that can be applied across a diverse patient group."
8,Acute Kidney Injury in the Geriatric Population.,"The aging kidney is more susceptible to injury. Thus, it is not surprising that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a disorder with a relative high incidence in the elderly population, especially those with critical illness. Given the comorbid conditions common in the geriatric population as well as the increase in exposure to various nephrotoxic insults, it is likely that the incidence of AKI will grow in the coming decades. Thus, it is critical to gain an understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways operative in increasing the susceptibility to AKI with an aim to design therapies that will mitigate the risk of AKI. In the meanwhile, meticulous attention to preventative strategic is critical. When AKI does occur and renal replacement therapy is needed, individual decision making is required and should not be based on age alone."
9,Expanding the Role for Kidney Biopsies in Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a highly heterogeneous, common, and potentially devastating condition associated with markedly increased hospital length of stay, cost, mortality, and morbidity. Expanding the role for kidney biopsies in AKI may offer fresh insights into disease heterogeneity, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. A number of challenges face investigators and clinicians considering research biopsies in AKI: ensuring patient safety, ensuring the ethical conduct of research studies, and maximizing the scientific yield of the kidney tissue obtained. The societal benefits of research that lead to novel strategies for preventing and treating AKI would be enormous. Rethinking our current approach to the role of kidney biopsy for AKI diagnosis and research may be a major step toward the promise of personalized medicine in nephrology."
