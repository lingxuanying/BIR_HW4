0,Acute kidney injury: an overview of pathophysiology and treatments.,"Acute kidney injury, or acute kidney failure, is thought to complicate 5% of hospital admissions (Cheung, Ponnusamy, & Anderton, 2008). Most healthcare providers are likely to encounter patients experiencing acute kidney injury. Nurses and other healthcare professionals can play a vital role in identifying patients at risk for acute kidney injury and aid early intervention by identifying decreased kidney function. This article summarizes the current literature on acute kidney injury, including the definition, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic tests, and current treatments and interventions."
1,Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Pediatric Patients: A Review of Research.,"Introduction: Pediatric patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) while hospitalized have longer hospital stays, increased morbidity and mortality, and are at an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease. Early recognition of AKI is becoming a major clinical focus. There is little research focusing on nursing interventions that may affect a pediatric patient's risk for developing AKI. The purpose of this review is to summarize reported predictors of AKI to improve its early recognition and treatment among hospitalized pediatric patients. Methods: A review of research was conducted to further identify risk factors of AKI among noncritically ill hospitalized pediatric patients. Results: The current literature demonstrated inconsistent findings in early recognition of AKI among hospitalized pediatric patients. Discussion: Interventions for early recognition and treatment of AKI should consider other variables, such as previous history of AKI and fluid status as risk factors, warranting additional research."
2,Acute kidney injury: lessons from experimental models.,"For decades severe tubular necrosis has been the hallmark of experimental models of acute renal failure (ARF), such as prolonged ischemia and reflow. This fits well with the still widely used traditional clinical term 'acute tubular necrosis'. Nevertheless, the rareness of tubular necrosis in human kidney biopsies in the background of hypoxic, toxic and septic AKI led to the adoption of a new term, 'acute kidney injury' (AKI), which refers to such clinical scenarios irrespective of the renal morphology. Indeed, experimental AKI models, which have more limited acute renal parenchymal compromise, underscore the focal and regional tissue injury patterns that range from adaptive stress response, through cellular dysfunction, apoptotic cell death and frank acute tubular necrosis. Such stress and injury patterns, short of necrosis, may go unnoticed morphologically and even functionally, and may even confer resistance to subsequent insults. Herein we describe the spectrum of what we call 'sublethal injury', referring to a condition, which by itself is insufficient to produce cellular death, but may or may not produce organ failure. Such sublethal injury can be detected by overt morphological changes, by the upregulation of cell survival factors, and by recently developed biomarkers and imaging techniques of organ physiology and dysfunction. The use of combined sublethal insults in animal models is an attempt to replicate the clinical situation of comorbidities, a circumstance which underlies most situations of AKI. This review will discuss the definition of such sublethal injury and the modes of its detection."
3,Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology: From Recognition to Intervention.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common among hospitalized patients, and the incidence of AKI has increased over the past few decades. This increase might be due to an aging population and increased comorbidities. Other factors that may explain this are the more sensitive diagnostic criteria and better recognition. AKI is associated with increased mortality and increased risks of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. The best ways to lower the chances of having kidney damage are to prevent, recognize and treat AKI as early as possible. The incidence of AKI in China is significantly lower than in developed countries. Inadequate early diagnosis and management remain the major challenges for Chinese nephrologists."

5,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-Associated Acute Kidney Injury: A Narrative Review Focused Upon Pathophysiology.,"Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury is a condition that in many ways resembles classical acute kidney injury. The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. Data sources: Literature review. Data synthesis: Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. Conclusions and relevance: Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a ""one-size-fits-all"" manner. The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment. Although data from the literature regarding the previous coronavirus infections can give some insights, more studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms of acute kidney injury occurring as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2."
6,Acute renal failure.,"This seminar covers the most recent information on definition, epidemiology, and clinical causes of acute renal failure. The mechanisms of acute prerenal failure and the potential interference by commonly used drugs of autoregulation of renal blood flow are discussed. We summarise some basic and recent insights into the haemodynamic and cellular pathophysiological mechanisms, mainly of postischaemic acute renal failure. Recent findings on the repair mechanisms of renal injury and the potential future therapeutic possibilities are discussed. We provide some differential diagnostic approaches for patients with acute renal failure and summarise prevention of the disorder and management of critically ill patients by dialysis and by other means. Finally, some information on the influence of gene polymorphisms on the prognosis of acute renal failure is given."
7,Acute kidney injury.,
8,[Acute kidney injury is a common and serious condition. The clinical significance is great and probably underestimated].,"Acute kidney injury, previously called acute renal failure, is very common in different health care settings. Acute kidney injury is strongly related to an increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, heart failure and dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. The established classification of acute kidney injury, KDIGO, uses changes in serum creatinine values, and/or urine output to define different stages (stages 1-3). Acute kidney injury stage 1 is defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels of 26 Î¼mol/l, or an 1.5-2-fold increase in serum creatinine levels compared with baseline values, which often goes undetected. The aim of this review was to give an overview of the classification, epidemiology, and importance of acute kidney injury for prognosis in different clinical settings."
9,Acute kidney injury in the elderly.,"Most patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) are older than 65 years. Specific structural and functional changes that occur in the aging kidney predispose the elderly patient to AKI. This risk is further compounded by comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, and the need for invasive procedures. When AKI does occur, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although morbidity and mortality increases with advancing age, many elderly patients can survive AKI and do well. Thus, decision making should be thoughtful and individualized, and not dependent on age. Whenever possible, preventive approaches should be pursued to lessen the burden of AKI."
