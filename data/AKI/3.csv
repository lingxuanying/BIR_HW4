0,[Perioperative acute kidney injury].,"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in the perioperative period and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. AKI is an independent risk factor for adverse outcome. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines define AKI based on increases in serum creatinine and/or urinary output. Since there is no causal therapy available, early detection and timely implementation of preventive measures are of particular importance. Objective: This article gives an overview of the disease picture of perioperative AKI. The recommendations on diagnostics, prevention and treatment are presented. Methods: The available evidence is summarized based on the currently available literature. Results: New renal biomarkers demonstrate kidney stress and are able to make an early prediction of the development of AKI. The implementation of the KDIGO bundles (discontinuation of all nephrotoxic medications, optimization of the volume status and perfusion pressure, consideration of an extended functional hemodynamic monitoring, close monitoring of serum creatinine concentration and urine output, avoidance of hyperglycemia and consideration of alternatives to radiocontrast agents) and remote ischemic preconditioning have shown a significant reduction in the incidence of AKI in high-risk patients. Conclusion: For timely diagnosis and prevention of AKI the recommendations for action of the KDIGO guidelines should be implemented. High-risk patients should be detected early in the perioperative period in order to be able to initiate preemptive strategies in a timely manner."
1,[Acute kidney injury in the newborn: a consensus statement].,"Acute kidney Injury is recognized as an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Additionally, in this age group, there are other aggravating factors, such as incomplete nephrogenesis in premature infants and lower nephron mass in low birth weight neonates. All this means that the newborn must be evaluated and managed differently from the pediatric patient. In the present consensus, we review the new definitions of acute kidney injury, etiologies, diagnostic methods and recommended treatments."
2,[Acute kidney injury in elderly patients].,"In the last few years, more and more studies have been focusing on Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) because of its incidence, its effects on patients, and the costs associated to its treatment. Elderly patients are especially in danger of developing AKI given the para-physiological deterioration of their renal functions and the presence of several co-morbidities. Together with sepsis, AKI is in fact one of the most common complications occurring during hospitalization. However, some strategies have proved to help in preventing renal damage in the elderly. Fluid overload, malnutrition and sepsis, which are far more common and momentous in older patients, can conceal or minimize rising creatinine levels. As such, it is not always possible to rely on the creatinine behaviour to diagnose AKI as proposed by KDIGO, AKIN e RIFLE guidelines. On the one hand, these and other peculiarities make AKI very difficult to diagnose and treat in elderly patients. On the other, the dialysis treatment, with its intrinsic ""un-physiology"", further complicates matters and (if it is very aggressive in terms of efficiency and removal of fluids) can destabilize these fragile patients and their poor haemodynamic compensation."
3,Acute Kidney Injury Risk Recognition in Resource-Sufficient Versus Resource-Limited Regions.,"Acute kidney injury is a very common complication of acute illnesses with dire consequences. There are significant differences in incidence, etiology, severity, and clinical impact of acute kidney injury between resource-sufficient and resource-limited regions. Awareness of such differences would potentially allow clinicians and policymakers to devise and provide region-specific interventions to decrease the incidence of acute kidney injury and mitigate its complications. In this review article, we describe the similarities and differences of acute kidney injury risk factors and risk stratifications based on the level of resource availability in different regions. We also outline differences between community- and hospital-acquired acute kidney injury in different countries. In the end, we outline the potential steps need to be taken to mitigate incidence and clinical impacts of acute kidney injury in both resource-sufficient and resource-limited regions."
4,Acute kidney injury following acute pancreatitis: A review.,"BACKROUND. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common serious complication of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and an important marker of morbidity and mortality in critically ill septic patients. AKI due to severe acute pancreatitis can be the result of hypoxemia, release of pancreatic amylase from the injured pancreas with impairment of renal microcirculation, decrease in renal perfusion pressure due to abdominal compartment syndrome, intraabdominal hypertension or hypovolemia. Endotoxins and reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play an important role in the pathophysiology of SAP and AKI. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of AKI following SAP might improve the therapeutic outcome of critically ill patients. Methods and results: An overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and potential treatment options based on a literature search of clinical human and experimental studies from 1987 to 2013. Conclusions: Early recognition of AKI and SAP in order to prevent severe complication like septic shock, intraabdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is a crucial tool of therapeutic measures in intensive care."

6,Acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a medical emergency associated with poor clinical outcomes. The international guideline group Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has defined AKI according to rises in serum creatinine and/or reductions in urine output. Any patient who meets the criteria for AKI should be reviewed to ascertain the cause of AKI and the severity of the injury should be staged. Patients with more severe AKI are at greater risk of progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 2009 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death (NCEPOD) reported that only 50% of patients who died with a diagnosis with AKI received good care. The mortality from AKI has remained unchanged for the last four decades and there are currently no specific therapies for the majority of cases of AKI. Patients with rarer forms of AKI need urgent renal referral for specific therapy. At present, serum creatinine and urine output remain the best biomarkers for detecting AKI. However, significant kidney damage has usually occurred by the time changes in these biomarkers are manifest and newer biomarkers are under investigation. Management of AKI is based upon general supportive measures, which includes treatment of the underlying cause and the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with complications refractory to medical management. The optimal choice of intravenous fluid therapy remains controversial. There is currently renewed interest in more specific therapies for AKI secondary to hypoperfusion and/or sepsis, which have been previously unsuccessful. A number of therapeutic strategies are presently being explored in clinical trials."
7,Acute kidney injury and 'nephrotoxins': mind your language.,"The introduction of the term 'acute kidney injury' (AKI) along with an international classification scheme,1 caused some initial confusion, but most clinicians and many patients now understand that the term 'injury' denotes damage to the internal workings of the kidney, rather than physical trauma. However, of greater concern is the use of the term 'nephrotoxic' to include drugs that are, in most settings, nephroprotective. We argue that this imprecise terminology, unfortunately adopted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) among others, is potentially harmful, and that the terms 'nephrotoxin' and 'nephrotoxic' should not be used to describe haemodynamically mediated and fully reversible effects of some drugs on excretory function."
8,Acute Kidney Injury in Active Wars and Other Man-Made Disasters.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequent during wars and other man-made disasters, and contributes significantly to the overall death toll. War-related AKI may develop as a result of polytrauma, traumatic bleeding and hypovolemia, chemical and airborne toxin exposure, and crush syndrome. Thus, prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal AKI may develop at the battlefield, in field hospitals, or tertiary care centers, resulting not only from traumatic, but also nontraumatic, etiologies. The prognosis usually is unfavorable because of systemic and polytrauma-related complications and suboptimal therapeutic interventions. Measures for decreasing the risk of AKI include making preparations for foreseeable disasters, and early management of polytrauma-related complications, hypovolemia, and other pathogenetic mechanisms. Transporting casualties initially to field hospitals, and afterward to higher-level health care facilities at the earliest convenience, is critical. Other man-made disasters also may cause AKI; however, the number of patients is mostly lower and treatment possibilities are broader than in war. If there is no alternative other than prolonged field care, the medical community must be prepared to offer health care and even perform dialysis in austere conditions, which in that case, is the only option to decrease the death toll resulting from AKI."
9,Renal regeneration after acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury is common and associated with negative renal and patient outcomes. The human kidney has a real but limited regeneration capacity. Understanding renal regeneration may allow us to manipulate this process and thus develop therapeutic weapons to improve patients' outcome. In the first part of this paper we discuss the clinical factors associated with renal recovery: baseline patient particularities, acute kidney injury characteristics and the medical approach taken in the short and long-term. In the second part, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying renal regeneration are explored. The immune system seems to have an important role, first promoting inflammation and then tissue healing. Other players, such as cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, renal haemodynamics and metabolic reprogramming also have a role in renal regeneration. We aim to develop a short review of renal regeneration, offering a holistic view of this process."
